A flexible League of Legends integration for RGB LED devices.

## Usage
- Setup a LED strip that listens to color data via sACN. If you don't have a LED strip, you will be able to see the simulated LED display in your screen.
- Load into a LoL game (preferably with Vel'Koz)
- When the game loads, open the program
- Enjoy the lights!
